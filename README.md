# Posts Search SPA

By Alexandre da Costa.

This is a simple Vue.js TypeScript project to demonstrate my skills with it.

It is an SPA that searches for posts from a REST API and displays them in a list with title, body excerpt, date and author name.

## Requirements

1. Node.js and NPM

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Edit the .env file to set the API URL, if needed.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server at default port 5173.
    - Or run `vite --port <PORT>` to start the development server at a custom port.
5. Open the browser at http://localhost:5173, or change the port if you used a custom one.
